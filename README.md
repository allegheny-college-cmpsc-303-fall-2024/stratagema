# Stratagema 
## Group Activity

This group actiivty will help you get familiar with **agents**, **states**, and **actions** in search problems. TODO: Add more terms? You will complete the program so that the computer wins the game playing randomly TODO: update this?

## Course Learning Outcomes

This assignment builds toward CLO #1 (implementing an intelligent agent) and CLO #2 (applying search algorithms). You can read more about CLOs [here](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-303-fall-2024/course-materials/blob/main/README.md#course-learning-outcomes). 




TODO: inlcude env no env options

TODO: explain deep_copy and set

part 1: neighbors, moves, terminal, diagonal

part 2: compare random, dfs, and bfs

- finish solve function
- create solution list for dfs, bfs, and random
- output path cost AND time to solution for each 
- output a png that compares the three

This assignment is titled with affection toward *Star Trek: TNG*. Game play is sort of loosely comparable. 

## Grading

Two receive a **satisfactory** grade on this assignment you must:

- Pass X/X Gatorchecks
- Answer 2/3 mystery questions correctly during the lab section following the deadline

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
>  **It's a good idea to review your assignment right before lab.** You must answer mystery questions verbally during lab time in order to receive credit for this assignment, without looking at your repo. You will answer these questions one-on-one with a professor or TL.
